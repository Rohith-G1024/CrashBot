# CrashBot
This is a Discord bot developed using JavaScript.

To use it:
1. Clone/download this repo
2. Register the bot by following the steps in [this video](https://youtu.be/j_sD9udZnCk?t=515) till you obtain the token for the bot.
3. Create a *config.json* file and add in the following code and replace *<the bot's token>* with the copied token:
```
{
	"token": "<the bot's token>"
}
```
>Note: 
>1. This token will be personal to your account and is not to be uploaded/exposed anywhere, failing which invites security risks.
>2. The whole point of creating a *config.json* file was a way to not expose the token which I got for my own bot.
4. Setup the environment by installing [these dependencies](https://youtu.be/j_sD9udZnCk?t=66) as shown in the same video as above.
5. Once you've added the bot to your server, run ***start.bat*** to bring the bot online.
6. That's it! You can follow the [tutorial series](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLbbLC0BLaGjpyzN1rg-gK4dUqbn8eJQq4) linked with the above video and customize your bot accordingly.
